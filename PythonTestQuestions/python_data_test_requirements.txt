In this directory you will find an excel spreadsheet titled "Privia Family Medicine 113018.xlsx" containing demographics,
quarter and risk data. We need this data to be manipulated and stored in our PersonDatabase for analysis.

Please include solutions to the questions below using python 2.7.
Please include any required modules in a "requirements.txt" file in this directory.
Please provide adequate test coverage for you solutions.

1. Import the 'Demographics' data section to a table in the database. This ETL will need to process files of the
same type delivered later on with different file dates and from different groups.
    a. Include all fields under 'Demographics'
    b. Define the sql schema as necessary. Fields should not include spaces or special characters.
    c. Include fields in the data table that indicate the date of the file and the provider group located in the filename.
        In this case "Privia Family Medicine" 11/30/2018. Assume the length of the group name will change and the date
        will always be formatted at the end of the file as MMDDYY
    d. Include only the first initial of the Middle Name when applicable.
    e. Convert the Sex value to M or F: M for 0 and F for 1


2. Transform and import the 'Quarters' and 'Risk' data into a separate table.
    a. Unpivot the data so that the data table includes
        i. ID
        ii. Quarter
        iii. Attributed flag
        iv. Risk Score
        v. File date
     b. Only include records in which the patients risk has increased.
     
     
     My scripts required only two modules: os and pyodbc.
