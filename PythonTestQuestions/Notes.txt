Notes:
     
     In the beginning I planned to use xlrd to get the data from Excel files, but it was too cumbersome to deal with the fields converted
     to float, especially with the date fields, so after wasting a lot of time I ended up with using MS OpenRowset approach. In hindsight, 
     using pandas with dataframes would be probably more Pythonish, but it is too late now.
     
     I created two more source files to fully test both scripts. My assumption is that the source Excel files will be provided in a directory, the name of which is passed as a parameter to the scripts. 
     My testing is done with SQL Server 2014 Express. I am including the SQL script with command that are required to make OpenRowset to work. I also include the CSV files from the resulting 
     Demographics (Q1) and Attribution(Q2) tables.
